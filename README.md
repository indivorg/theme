# Indiv Theme

[Indiv](https://indiv.no) theme, made for [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com).

## Quickstart

```shell
▶ yarn add @indivorg/theme
```

## Development

```shell

```

This starts a Next.js instance. We've laid out all components from Theme UI, so
you can easily stylize these with the theme (with hot reload etc.).
